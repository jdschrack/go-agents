# go-agents

The go agents application provides a framework for building an agentic pipeline (Agent Development Framework) using the Go programming language. It allows developers to create, manage, and execute autonomous agents that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with various APIs and services.

This is loosely inspired by [metzben/agents](https://github.com/metzben/agents)
